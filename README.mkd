SmallGraphs
===========
Created by Jaeho Shin

SmallGraphs initialy began as a final project for the
[Data Visualization course at Stanford University][cs448b].  You can
find [a short paper about it][cs448b-finalpaper] with more information
from [its wiki page][cs448b-finalproject].

Quick Start
-----------

To build the code into usable state, run:

    make

You can open `index.html` from Safari or Chrome to use the frontend UI.


To publish everything to Github, run:

    make publish

To run the backend graphd server, run:

    make graphd

You will need to specify the information required for connecting to the
underlying MySQL database with the graph layout definitions in a `graphd.json`
file at `graphd/graphs/YOURGRAPHNAME/graphd.json` to access it from
`http://YOURHOSTNAME:53411/YOURGRAPHNAME`.


Layout
------

 * Frontend UI
   * `index.html` contains most of the code
   * `jquery-*`, `d3` are the modules UI depends on
   * `resource/` contains some images used in the UI
 * Backend Graph Query Processor
   * `graphd/graphd.coffee` contains the backend code
 * SmallGraph DSL
   * `smallgraph/` contains the parser and serializer for our SmallGraph DSL


Links
-----

 * SmallGraphs' frontend UI works with a WebKit-based browser, such as
   Safari or Chrome.  It heavily depends on [jQuery][] and
   [jQuery UI][].  [jQuery-SVG][] and [jQuery-cookie][] made it
   possible to keep the code short.  [d3.js][] also played an
   important role in visualizing the results.
 * The backend [GraphD][] server runs on top of [node.js][] and
   connects to MySQL databases with [node-mysql][].
 * SmallGraph parser is generated with [Jison][].
 * Most parts are written in JavaScript and [CoffeeScript][].
